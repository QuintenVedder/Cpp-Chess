# Cpp Chess
chess made with C++ and sfml

some of the assets used are created by WildlifeStudios and are available here:
https://wildlifestudios.itch.io/chess-set-pixel-art

the executable files can be found in src/ under the name chess-linux-mac and chess-windows.exe.

the program consists of the main.cpp file containing the game loop, a utilities.h file containing most functions/methods and the pieceClass.h containing the class i used for the chess pieces.

for now the file structure is a mess, i will propably change that in the near future.
